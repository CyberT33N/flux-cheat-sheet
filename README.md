## Weights
- By contrast, T5 encoder works more like an LLM. So weights like in SD e.g. (ambient light:2) not working. The solution is adjectives and specificity. If you type "big", try "very big", or "slightly big". If you want to be specific, "as big as a giraffe" or "a little bigger than average."

# White background

## Letter C

<br><br>

### futuristic

version 1:
```
Create a futuristic logo with the letter 'C' morphing into a holographic-inspired shape. Use iridescent colors that shift between blue, purple, and green. The design should feel multidimensional and otherworldly, with a crisp white background to let the holographic colors shine.
```

version 2 **hot**:
```
Design an ultra-high-quality, futuristic logo centered around the letter 'C' that seamlessly morphs into an ethereal, holographic-inspired symbol. This transformation should convey a sense of depth and multi-dimensionality, as though the logo exists in both physical and digital realms. Embrace an iridescent color palette that flows smoothly between electric blues, deep purples, and shimmering emerald greens, creating a captivating spectral effect.

The ‘C’ should appear fluid, almost as if it’s being formed from or dissolving into beams of light, with subtle gradients and fine detailing to achieve a hyper-realistic, prism-like quality. Add delicate glows and reflections to amplify the holographic feel, but keep the lines clean, crisp, and precise, avoiding any visual clutter.

Each layer of color should reflect and refract to mimic the look of light passing through crystal, achieving a radiant, high-end finish. Ensure the logo remains distinct against a pristine white background, allowing the holographic colors to appear vibrant, vivid, and truly luminous. Every element should feel futuristic and immersive, capturing the essence of a high-tech, otherworldly aesthetic.
```








<br><br>
<br><br>

### glass

version 1
```
Create a Glassmorphism-inspired logo featuring only the letter 'C' as the central focus. Design the 'C' with a bold, sleek, and high-tech style against a pure white background. Use a subtle gradient of neon blue and electric purple within the 'C' to give it a sense of modernity and digital depth.

Apply a frosted glass effect to add dimension and a hint of transparency, making the 'C' feel light, clean, and futuristic. Ensure the overall design is minimalist yet striking, capturing a cutting-edge, tech-oriented aesthetic.
```

version 2 **hot**
```
Design a crystal-clear 'C' with a Glassmorphism effect. Inside the 'C,' incorporate subtle, frosted circuit patterns that hint at the logo's tech focus. Use a white background and a soft gradient of deep blue and neon purple along the edges, giving the 'C' an icy, crystalline look that feels minimal yet intricate. This ‘C’ should embody sophistication and digital connectivity.
```


version 3 **hot**
```
Design a sleek and dynamic logo featuring the letter 'C' with an interactive, fluid motion towards the text '</>'. The letter should appear as if it's being transformed by code, flowing with smooth, curving lines. The color scheme should be a mix of dark tones with vibrant neon highlights, reflecting both innovation and creativity in the software development field.
```

version 4
```
Design a fluid, modern logo with the letter 'C' that melts into the symbol '</>'. Focus on smooth, flowing lines with an elegant curvature, creating a sense of constant movement. Choose a palette of dark metallic tones with neon accents, adding a high-tech feel to the design. The transition between the 'C' and '</>' should feel natural and effortless.
```

version 5 **extrem hot**
```
Design a cutting-edge logo where the letter 'C' subtly morphs into the symbol '</>', creating an elegant, fluid transition. The 'C' should be soft, yet bold, with a futuristic and clean look. Use a dark, tech-inspired color palette with smooth transitions in silver, blue, and neon accents to suggest a modern, innovative approach to software development.
```




<br><br>

### futuristic

version 1 **hot**
```
Design a futuristic logo featuring the letter 'C' with a smooth, organic transition into the symbol '</>'. The 'C' should appear as a sleek, flowing curve, seamlessly merging into the coding symbol. Use a color palette of cool gradients, like deep indigos and subtle neon accents, to evoke a sense of advanced technology and digital innovation.
